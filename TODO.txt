TO DO:
------------

Downloading stock data:
1. Add the ability to append the stock data that has been downloaded now to the historical data downloaded earlier
2. Add the ability to create files with different intervals e.g. instead of the downloaded five minute candle, we may want to check for 15 minute or 30 minute or a daily candle. It can be in multiple of five minutes. The code should have the ability to look at the downloaded stock data with five-minute candle and produce stock data with a candle of longer duration.

Order Management
1. Add the Ability to place a limit order for either buy/sell
2. Add the ability to retrieve historical data
